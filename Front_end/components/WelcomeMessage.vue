      Getting Started
    </h3>
    <p>To get started click the '<strong class="font-medium">Add New Lead</strong>' button on the left.</p>
    <p>You can add as much or as little information as you want. We just ask that you at least enter the company name.</p>
    <p>The status will default to 'Application Sent', be sure to keep this updated when the application process moves along.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl text-gray-900 font-semibold py-2">
      Leave some notes
    </h3>
    <p>We've made it easy to add notes about a particular job application. Here are some suggestions to get you started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>List of questions you'd like to ask during the interview.</li>
      <li>For multi-part interviews leave notes about the last conversation you had.</li>
      <li>Things that stuck out when looking into the company. Bring these up during the interview!</li>
    </ul>

        One more thing!
      </h2>
      <p>Be sure to check out the <a href="/questions">Questions &amp; Answers</a> section to save some frequently asked interview questions.</p>
      <p>Then leave a good answer that you can come back and reference later. This will save you a lot of time, especially with those online applications that all ask the exact same question.</p>
